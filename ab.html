      <h1>To a Pure Soul (II)</h1>
    </div>
    <p>The world is not kind to souls like yours. It does not know what to do with something so untamed, so unwilling to bow to its illusions. It will try to reshape you, to quiet the fire in your chest, to tell you that softness must mean surrender, that faith must bend to fit its design. It will offer you comfort wrapped in chains—freedom that costs your very soul.</p>
    <p>Do not let it.</p>
    <p>You were not meant to be molded by hands that do not know your worth. You were not meant to give your heart to what withers at the first touch of time. You were not meant to dim your brilliance to appease those who do not seek the truth. Even if those who love you may one day fear the intensity of your light, let that not become your burden.</p>
    <p>There will be days when you question, when the weight of your thoughts becomes unbearable, when you stand at the crossroads of desire and restraint. In those moments, the world may tempt you with a path of ease—a path that demands nothing yet takes everything from you.</p>
    <p>Resist. Even when the silence is deafening, when your prayers seem to vanish into the void, remember that ease is not always a blessing, and suffering is not always a curse. What is taken is often what was never meant to remain, and what breaks you may be the very force that molds you into something greater.</p>
    <p>You are not weak for feeling, for longing, for yearning for a love that transcends the temporal. You are not foolish for believing that there exists a love which does not demand the betrayal of your true self. Yet know that some desires lead to ruin, and some sacrifices pave the path to salvation. You will be tested with both.</p>
    <p>And when the time comes, when your heart teeters on the edge of its own longing, I implore you—</p>
    <p>Ya Allah, do not let her be deceived by the ephemeral. Do not let her reach for that which will slip away like sand. Let her heart yearn only for what draws her ever nearer to You. If she is to love, may it be for the sake of eternity rather than the fleeting comforts of this transient world. If she is to suffer, let it purify her, not lead her astray.</p>
    <p>Ya Allah, shield her from all that seeks to pull her from Your embrace. Preserve her soul in a world that revels in its destruction. Grant her strength to walk when the path grows treacherous, even as unseen wounds weigh upon her.</p>
    <p>And when she has exhausted all that she can give, when her spirit feels spent and her voice is hushed—then, Ya Allah, bestow upon her that which surpasses all her desires. Let her find solace where sorrow is but a memory, let her discover peace in the nearness of the One who never forsakes.</p>
    <p class="signature">yours, faithfully.</p>
